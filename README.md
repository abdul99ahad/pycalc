# Python Scientific Calculator

We were instructed to make use of functions only, to implement python based scientific calculator having all sorts of scientific features. This was a 1st semester project of Computer Programming so it's pretty basic. 

## Libraries used: 
    math 
    tkinter
    
I know the GUI is ugly but this is programmed by the person who has little to no knowledge of programming in his first semester.
